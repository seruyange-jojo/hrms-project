# Backend Collaboration Guide

## Option 1: GitHub/GitLab (Recommended)

### Create a Repository
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial HR System frontend commit"

# Create repository on GitHub/GitLab and push
git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Share with Backend Developer
1. **Invite them to the repository** as collaborator
2. They clone and work on backend in separate folder
3. Both projects can coexist in same repo or separate repos

### Repository Structure
```
hr-system/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # Your React app (current)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # Their backend API
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BACKEND_API_DOCS.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ FRONTEND_README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Option 2: Share Files Directly

### Zip and Send
1. Create a zip file of your project
2. Send via email, USB drive, or cloud storage
3. Include all documentation files

### Files Backend Developer Needs:
```
âœ… src/services/api.ts        (API contract)
âœ… BACKEND_API_DOCS.md         (API specs)
âœ… BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md      (Setup guide)
âœ… QUICK_START_BACKEND.md      (Quick reference)
âœ… FRONTEND_README.md          (Frontend docs)
âœ… .env.example                (Environment setup)
```

## Option 3: Use Demo Mode First

### Temporary Setup
- Keep using demo mode (`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`)
- Let backend developer work independently
- Connect when their API is ready

### When Backend is Ready
1. Change `.env` to remove demo mode
2. Set `VITE_API_URL` to backend URL
3. Test connection

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Share the documentation files** (they contain everything needed)
2. **Backend developer builds API** in their environment
3. **Both test separately** using their own data
4. **Integration testing** when both are ready

## What Each Developer Needs

### You (Frontend Developer):
- âœ… Frontend code is ready
- âœ… Documentation is complete
- âœ… Just wait for backend API

### Backend Developer Needs:
- ðŸ“„ `BACKEND_API_DOCS.md` - What to build
- ðŸ“„ `BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - How to build it
- ðŸ“„ `QUICK_START_BACKEND.md` - Quick reference
- ðŸ“„ `src/services/api.ts` - See expected API calls

## Quick Share Package

Send these files:
```
1. BACKEND_API_DOCS.md
2. BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md  
3. QUICK_START_BACKEND.md
4. FRONTEND_README.md (optional, for reference)
```

That's all they need to build the backend!

## Testing Together

Once backend is built:

```bash
# Backend developer runs:
docker-compose up

# You run frontend:
npm run dev

# Test together:
# http://localhost:5173
```
