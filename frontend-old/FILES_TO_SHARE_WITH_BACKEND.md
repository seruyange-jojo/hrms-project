# Files to Share with Backend Developer

## Essential Files (Must Have)

Share these files with your backend developer - they contain everything needed to build the API:

### 1. API Documentation Files

✅ **BACKEND_API_DOCS.md**  
Complete API specification with all endpoints, request/response formats, and data models.

✅ **BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md**  
Detailed setup guide including Docker configuration, database schema, and deployment checklist.

✅ **QUICK_START_BACKEND.md**  
Quick reference with minimal requirements and essential endpoints.

### 2. API Integration Code

✅ **src/services/api.ts**  
The actual API integration code showing exact endpoints and expected responses. This is your API contract.

### 3. Documentation

✅ **BACKEND_COLLABORATION.md**  
How to collaborate and work together on this project.

✅ **FRONTEND_README.md**  
Frontend documentation (for reference).

## How to Share

### Option 1: Email/Folder Sharing
1. Copy these files to a folder
2. Zip the folder
3. Send via email or cloud storage

**Files to include:**
- BACKEND_API_DOCS.md
- BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- QUICK_START_BACKEND.md
- BACKEND_COLLABORATION.md
- src/services/api.ts
- FRONTEND_README.md (optional)

### Option 2: GitHub/GitLab
1. Create a repository
2. Upload these files
3. Share repository link with backend developer

### Option 3: Use Demo Mode
- Frontend works in demo mode (mock data)
- Backend developer can build independently
- Connect when both are ready

## What Backend Developer Needs to Build

### Minimum Requirements
1. REST API on `http://localhost:3000/api`
2. JWT authentication
3. CORS enabled for `http://localhost:5173`
4. All endpoints from BACKEND_API_DOCS.md

### Essential Endpoints to Start
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /api/employees` - Get employees list

Once these 3 work, the app becomes functional!

## Testing Together

When backend is ready:

```bash
# Backend developer runs:
docker-compose up

# You run frontend:
npm run dev

# Test at: http://localhost:5173
```

## Support

If backend developer has questions:
- API specs: BACKEND_API_DOCS.md
- Setup help: BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Quick reference: QUICK_START_BACKEND.md

All files are in your project root directory!
